# GitHub Setup Instructions

1. First, ensure you're in the project directory and initialize git:
```bash
cd client
git init
```

2. Add all files:
```bash
git add .
```

3. Create your first commit:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial frontend commit"
```

4. Add your GitHub repository as the remote (replace with your repository URL):
```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
```

5. Push your code:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Note: Make sure you have:
- Created the repository on GitHub first
- Have Git installed and configured with your GitHub credentials
- Replace YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL with your actual GitHub repository URL

Example URL format: `https://github.com/username/promptpilot-frontend.git`
